Lightweight Extensible Feed Reader

### Installation
Copy `.ticker.example.conf` to `.ticker.conf` to get started quickly,
or use it as a guide to create your own `.ticker.conf`. Be mindful that
a single tab must be used between channel names and RSS URLs

The `ticker.py` script may be run in place without any further installation.
